        Regretting You begins in the past as 17-year-old Morgan spends the summer with her boyfriend Chris Grant, her sister Jenny, and Jenny’s boyfriend Jonah Sullivan. Morgan acts as a mother figure for Jenny and feels a silent bond with Jonah, who demonstrates a maturity that Morgan admires. Chris and Jenny indulge in alcohol and drugs. Soon, Morgan discovers that she is pregnant with Chris’s child.

        Seventeen years in the future, Chris and Morgan’s 16-year-old daughter Clara drives home after school and notices a classmate named Miller Adams abandoned on the side of the road. She picks up Miller and drives him home. Miller lies to his girlfriend Shelby about his interactions with Clara and follows Clara on social media.

        At home, 34-year-old Morgan and her sister Jenny prepare for Morgan’s birthday dinner with the family. Jenny says that she and Jonah will be getting married; they broke up as teenagers and Jonah disappeared, but they reconciled briefly for a one-night stand and later discovered that Jenny was pregnant. Angry with Jonah about his abrupt departure years ago, Morgan avoids him. The family sits down for dinner. Chris, now Morgan’s husband, works at a local hospital where Jenny works as a nurse. Jonah teaches at Clara’s high school. When Chris learns of Clara’s encounter with Miller, he forbids Clara from seeing him and discourages her from pursuing acting as a profession. Morgan feels isolated during the dinner. Later that evening, Morgan informs Chris of her decision to return to college. Morgan and Clara partake in their tradition of completing a birthday vision board. Morgan decides her goal will be to find her passion.

        Later that day, Morgan receives a call that Chris has been in a car accident. Unaware that Jenny was also in the accident, Morgan arrives at the hospital and discovers Jonah there. Jonah and Morgan attempt to uncover why Chris and Jenny were driving together and learn that Jenny lied about having to return to work. To protect Clara, they tell her that Jenny picked up Chris after he had a flat tire. A doctor informs Jonah and Morgan that Chris and Jenny are dead.

        Two weeks later, Clara avoids going home after numerous fights with her mother over her relationship with Miller. After Miller informs Clara that he has broken up with his girlfriend, he picks Clara up from a coffee shop, and they hang out. They share their first kiss after Miller admits that he has had a crush on Clara for three years. At her home, Morgan and Jonah discuss whether to tell Clara and Elijah the truth about Chris and Jenny. Morgan insists on protecting Clara and hiding the truth.
